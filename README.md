# Decorative Panels Nook
A furniture store app which increases the customer engagement with the manufacturer. This app specializes in decorative panels alone in order for the client to not only customize but also search for desired panels based off of size, color, brand, thickness, face dimension and design continuity. 

# Technologies Used:
* Passport
* Bootstrap
* React
* Redux
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* jQuery
* MongoDB

Node packages included:
* Express
* Path
* Body-parser
* Express-Session
* Mongoose

Start this app with the following command:
$ npm run start:dev-full

# Challenges:
Redux itself is very complex and having to learn and apply it was one of our biggest challenge. Another challenge was merging our work with the master repo. Overall, communication was key and everyone did a great job staying in-touch.

# Improvements:
We would love to incorporate a larger database with a bigger variety of furniture. We have not yet included a pay system after checking out and would love to also include that technology as the final step for this app.
